This web was made by Gerard Ramon(Kramtron on GitHub),Spanish student of CITM,UPC, this is a personal research with the objective of explain how to do a good dialog system and how to introduce it into the rpg.




# Introduction




# What is a dialogue system?
It is the way to emulate a conversation between the player and a character controlled by the machine (NPC).
Normally they are predefined phrases by the creators of the video game that depending on the moment are loaded on the screen to show them to the player.
